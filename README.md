# winduino

A small bridge for Arduino applications to allow them to be roughly prototyped on a
Windows PC using UIX or DirectX for the display.

I have not tested with LVGL yet, but it should work.

To build the project you'll need mingw. I use GCC 12 or above but earlier versions *might* choke.

For an example. see [this github rep](https://github.com/codewitch-honey-crisis/winduino)
